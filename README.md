The app is in the app directory, the SaSS files are in the src
directory. To start the server use the **grunt** command, to build
and minified, use **grunt build**.

### Todo
1. Code needs to be refactored.
2. Want to use the Sass setup.
3. finish setting up my copy of sites with missing links.
4. ~Fix the anchor tags around div tags.~
5. Find new hosting (I let my contract run out to move on to a VPS)
6. Use github pages or Surge to host this site until I'm finished with new one.
